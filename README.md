# Budget tracker

This application, built with Vue.js, is a Progressive Web App (PWA) designed to help users manage their budget efficiently. Users can sign in to the application using their Google account, and it leverages Google Firestore for data storage and real-time updates. Once the application is up and running, users can sign in with their Google account, start adding their financial transactions, upload receipts, and monitor their budget through the interactive pie chart. Notifications will keep users informed about their budgetary activities and important updates.
